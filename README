This is Palm::SMS, a Perl module for reading, manipulating, and
writing the .pdb files used by Handspring SMS application on PalmOS
devices such as Handspring Treo 270.  More recent devices have
partial support, and will use other device-specific modules if they
are available.

Palm::SMS module is the result of a reverse engineering attempt of
trasforming a Handspring Treo 270 SMS PDB file into a plain text file.
The PDB test file was produced by Handspring's application SMS
v. 3.5H.

Due to lack of knowledge about how PDB files work and what format SMS
database files conform to, at present this module is not suitable for
from-scratch SMS generation.  Conversely, you may find it extremely
useful if you intend to extract SMS messages from merged PDB files and
convert them to a human readable form.

I heard rumors that SMS format changes with GSM network providers.
Please, contact me if this module cannot correctly handle your
messages, hopefully attaching a patch which corrects the shortcoming.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
