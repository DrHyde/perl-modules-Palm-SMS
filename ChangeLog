        * MANIFEST: Forgot t/sample.pdb.

        * Makefile.PL, META.yml, MANIFEST: META.yml is no longer generated
        by a 'make dist', because we want to be able to specify our own
        field like 'reccomends:' or 'license:'.

        * README, Makefile.PL, lib/Palm/SMS.pm: I expect to update
        lib/Palm/SMS.pm less frequently than bin/smsdump.  Hence, module
        version can not be automatically determined from lib/Palm/SMS.pm,
        but manually set.  Noteworthy changes section in README will be
        showing both lib/Palm/SMS.pm and bin/smsdump versions.
